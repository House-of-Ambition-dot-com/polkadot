//! # Overseer
//!
//! `overseer` implements the Overseer architecture described in the
//! [implementers-guide](https://w3f.github.io/parachain-implementers-guide/node/index.html).
//! For the motivations behind implementing the overseer itself you should
//! check out that guide, documentation in this crate will be mostly discussing
//! technical stuff.
//!
//! An `Overseer` is something that allows spawning/stopping and overseing
//! asynchronous tasks as well as establishing a well-defined and easy to use
//! protocol that the tasks can use to communicate with each other. It is desired
//! that this protocol is the only way tasks communicate with each other, however
//! at this moment there are no foolproof guards against other ways of communication.
//!
//! The `Overseer` is instantiated with a pre-defined set of `Subsystems` that
//! share the same behavior from `Overseer`'s point of view.
//!
